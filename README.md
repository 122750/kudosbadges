# why should I want to create kudos artwork?

## Why

Kudos are a recurring revenue stream for artists.

## What 

Kudos is a [non-fungible token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token) that is created on the [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) blockchain, and can be sold to the [Gitcoin Kudos marketplace](https://gitcoin.co/kudos).  

## Compensation

There are two options for compensation for Kudos:

1. *Self Soveirgn* - When a new Kudos is created, the ETH sent during that minting process is directly sent to the illustrator who created the Kudos artwork. In some cases, Gitcoin may also take a 10% fee to help keep the lights on.
1. *Gitcoin-Funded* - Gitcoin will pay you for each piece of artwork, and will collect the Self Soveirgn (#1) funds.  [Email us](mailto:founders@gitcoin.co) a link to your portfolio to be considered.

Right now, we expect that most ppl will want to do Gitcoin-Funded kudos art. But down the line, when people are making $100s per day off their Kudos art, we hope people will consider the Self Soveirgn route.

# Dev Stuff

## Naming schema

For consistency, name all images with all lowercase letters and underscores between each word.  For example,

- level_up.svg
- night_owl.svg

## kudos.yaml file

This file contains the information about each of the kudos artifacts.  When adding a new Kudos, please add a corresponding record to the file.

## init_kudos.py

This python script reads the **images** directory and creates a kudos.yaml file.  It uses the filename to create the `name`, the `image` field.  The rest of the fields are sample defaults.

You only need to run this script if the kudos.yaml file doesn't already exist.
